`use-react-workers` is a powerful library that allows you to run JavaScript code in a separate thread using Web Workers. One of the features of this library is the ability to use third-party scripts within the worker.

## How to Use Third-Party Scripts

To use a third-party script, you need to pass the URL of the script to the `remoteDependencies` option when you initialize the worker hook (useWorker, useWorkerFunc, etc..). The `remoteDependencies` option accepts an array of URLs.

Here's an simple example using the `mathjs` library:

```ts
const [mathWorker, { status }] = useWorkerFunc(mathFunc, {
  remoteDependencies: ['https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjs/10.4.0/math.min.js'],
});
```

In this example, the mathjs library is loaded into the worker's context and can be used anywhere within the `mathFunc`

:::note

- The functions from the third-party scripts are not automatically imported into the global scope. They are part of the exported object of the library. For example, if you're using `mathjs`, you need to call the functions as `self.math.floor` instead of just `floor`.
- The scripts must be compatible with Web Workers. Not all JavaScript libraries can be used in a Web Worker. Some libraries rely on APIs that are not available in workers, such as the DOM API.

### Example

Here's an example of how you can use a third-party script in a worker:

```ts
import { useWorkerFunc } from 'use-react-workers';

function myFunction(n) {
  return self.math.floor(n);
}

function MyComponent() {
  const [myWorker, { status }] = useWorkerFunc(myFunction, {
    remoteDependencies: ['https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjs/10.4.0/math.min.js'],
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => myWorker(2.6)}>Calculate</button>
      <p>Status: {status}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Ca
In this example, the `myFunction` function uses the floor function from the `mathjs` library. The `mathjs` library is loaded into the worker's context using the `remoteDependencies` option.
